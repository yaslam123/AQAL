When designing modern technology-based solutions, one of the most essential aspects to consider is the community that will use them. Designing with the community in mind ensures that the solutions not only meet the practical needs of individuals but also strengthen community bonds, foster inclusivity, and create environments where people feel connected and supported. By focusing on the specific needs of a community, technology becomes more than just a tool—it becomes a means for bringing people together and addressing collective challenges in innovative ways.

###### Community-Centered Design: Empowering Through Technology

Designing technology with the community in mind goes beyond addressing individual needs; it’s about fostering connection, inclusivity, and empowerment. In Somalia, where community plays a central role in everyday life, technology can be a tool for strengthening local networks. For instance, mobile applications that connect local artisans with global buyers can empower individuals economically, creating broader market access. Similarly, digital platforms for education allow children and adults in rural regions to gain valuable skills, helping bridge the educational gap without leaving their communities.

Technology becomes a means to foster economic growth and independence, from mobile banking solutions to platforms for local entrepreneurship. By incorporating these technologies into communities, Somali residents gain not only access to services but also a sense of ownership over the solutions they use. When technology is designed with the needs of the community at its core, it can level the playing field, bringing opportunities to underserved areas.
